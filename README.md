I Scraped and collected customer feedback by analysing third-party data from a website called skytrax using **BeautifulSoup**
The data was very messy and contained purely text. I performed data cleaning in order to prepare the data for analysis. 
When the data was cleaned, I performed my analysis to uncover some insights.
As a starting point, I looked at topics like modelling, sentiment analysis or wordclouds to provide me with some insight into the content of the reviews. 
I completed this task using **Python**, and
Presented my insights using **PowerPoint**
